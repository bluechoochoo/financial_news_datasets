# financial_news_datasets

TV network datasets, pre-analysis, mostly for future social share stuff.

files are csv.

Current versions contain segment title, date, segment description.

TBD:

Add segment length, segment URL.

Goal is to have raw data for every network financial news program.

I'm just writing these words so searchers will know they're in the right place:
CNBC, Bloomberg, Fox Business, Yahoo! Finance.
